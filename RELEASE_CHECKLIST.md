**Solution:** Ensure version constant is updated in source code and binary is rebuilt

### Issue: Install script downloads wrong version
**Solution:** Update version reference in install scripts and test

### Issue: Binary doesn't work on target platform
**Solution:** Verify GOOS and GOARCH settings, test on target platform

### Issue: Documentation out of sync
**Solution:** Review all docs before release, update version references

## Release Metrics

Track these metrics for each release:
- [ ] Download count after 24 hours
- [ ] Download count after 1 week
- [ ] GitHub stars/forks increase
- [ ] Issues reported post-release
- [ ] Documentation page views
